## For the past two years, I have been learning how to collect data from scratch

Then, for the past few months, I have learned that just knowing how to collect data is not sufficient enough to make a good living.

It's also, not very productive. 

Let's say you have learned some basic codings, just enough to build your own crawler, or use web API to collect data from the open web.

The next thing is you need to know is how to properly put those bits and pieces together to make some sense out of it.

As a product owner of a mid-sized company, I don't get to do a lot of data scraping myself, since we have a DB-ful of data that is being generated every second.

But this also means that I have a bag full of data that I can play around.

For the past few months, I have been trying to be friend with Excel. 
It is not going so well. I know some guys can put together a fancy dashboard out of Excel. Not really my thing.

**So I have been looking for an alternatives and here are some of the tools I ran into.**

*1. (If you know just enough Python to dabble around) Plotly and Streamlit*
> These two packages are absolutely powerful as they can let you create your own dashboard from scratch with just a few lines of codes.

*2. (If you or your company has enough money) Tableau*
> I just started to use Tableau with my grad school email. They give you a year-worth of subscription for free, along with some courses. 

*3. (If your company stores lots of raw data through Google Sheets) Google Data Studio*
> This bad boy has less basic visualization figures than Tableau, but so easy to put together a quick dashboard within an hour.
> You can also link your Googld Ads directly to Data Studio for more straight-forward visualization.

I will be working on my personal data visualization project as well as on behalf of my company.
So chances of me using several tools out of those list is pretty high.

I will try to frequently share my progresses here.

**Stay tuned!**
